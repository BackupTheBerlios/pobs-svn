---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  POBS is a work in progress and it will progress faster with
  userinput from people like you. My goal is to offer a tool
  which would be easy to use for  the average user and would
  be foolproof for the average kind of PHP code.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Urgent
------



Reporting
---------

* Provide hints about dubios codelines

  -> Provide hints and tips about dubious codelines after scanning PHP
     code. For instance, alert when setcookie function is called in script.

*  Write a proper reportfile 

   -> Although you can already print or save the HTML output generated by
      POBS.


Conversion
----------

Enhance POBS so that it deals with "problem coding lines" in a more secure
way. That is if a parameter is passed to a function with "var1=3&var2=4" POBS
would notice that the first parameter (var1) has no preceding ampersand but
should be replaced just like "var2". Also the first parameter of the
setcookie function can be replaced so that cookies do not have to be treated
as excluded variables anymore.


Miscellaneous
