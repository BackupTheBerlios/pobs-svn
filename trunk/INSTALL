Installing POBS
_________________________________________________________________


BASIC INSTALLATION
==================

Installing POBS is as easy as I could think of. Just unzip the downloaded
file (which presumably you have already done as you're reading this) and put
it in a directory that is accessible by your web-server. POBS is a collection
of files in just 1 directory.

Before executing POBS you are advised to read the manual that is provided
through the POBS website at http://pobs.mywalhalla.net. Also check the
settings in pobs-ini.inc and adjust them to suit your needs. When you run
POBS for the first time you should at least adjust the $SourceDir and the
$TargetDir variables.

If you have a large amount of PHP source to be POBSed, check your php.ini and
see whether it runs in "Safe mode" (also, POBS warns for it). If it does,
POBS can not adjust the timeout setting as indicated in pobs-ini.inc and the
processing might be terminated before POBS has finished the replacement of
all your PHP codefiles. You might need to restart your webserver after
adjusting the php.ini file.

After having checked everything and having adjusted the settings in
pobs-ini.inc you point your browser to pobs.php and press <Enter>.


COMMAND LINE USAGE
==================

The command line version of POBS requires no installation whatsoever. It
assumes, however, that you have a working PHP-CLI installation, and can
execute scripts via the command line.

Invoke the POBS command line program as shown:

$ php cmd_line/pobs.php [SOURCE_FILE] | [SOURCE_DIR]

To get a brief usage message, simply pass the --help option to pobs.php or
run the program with no arguments.

Requirements and results to be expected when POBSing:

1)  - When POBS is run against a SOURCE_FILE, SOURCE_FILE must be readable by
      the user invoking the PHP binary, and the directory where SOURCE_FILE
      lives must be writable by the same user.

    - When POBS is run against a SOURCE_DIR, the directory in which
      SOURCE_DIR lives must be writable by the user executing POBS.php.

2)  - When POBS is run against a SOURCE_FILE, a backup of the original file be
      created and will have the name SOURCE_FILE.pobs.bak, and the
      SOURCE_FILE will become the POBS'ed file.

    - When POBS is run against a SOURCE_DIR, the original source dir
      SOURCE_DIR will remain untouced, but a new directory SOURCE_DIR_pobsed
      will be created in the same folder as SOURCE_DIR.
