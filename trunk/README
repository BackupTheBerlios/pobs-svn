INTRODUCTION

  POBS is a PHP Code Obfuscator that requires PHP 5. It replaces user-defined
  functions, constants and variables with an MD5 key.

  Features are:
  
  * No need for external libraries or decoders.
  * Quite hard to reverse-enginner.
  * Cross-platform. Runs on any machine with PHP 5.
  * Can obfuscate PHP code written for any PHP version.
  * Allows use of other encoders such as the Zend Encoder.
  * Open source. Free to scrutinize the code and re-distribute.
  * Highly efficient and fast. User friendly.
  * Continually evolving, and feature rich.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

  - Apache*          (>= 1.3.3)
  - PHP              (>= 5.0.1)

 *The Apache Web Server is required only if running in www mode.
 *Any web server that runs PHP can be used in place of Apache.

INSTALLING

  Refer to the file INSTALL for installation guidelines.

QUICK USAGE SUMMARY

  Wouldn't be cool to be able to do something like this just before you ship your PHP code to a client?

  $ php pobs.php my-sourcedir
  $ mv my-sourcedir_pobsed myPHPApp

  And then distribute a zipped copy of myPHPApp to your client. Your client
  would then *have* to come to you for bug fixes and feature requests, and you
  would be able to sleep well knowing that your intellectual property is
  still under your domain.
