<h1>Debug Tips</h1>

The downside of POBS is that it won't
guarantee that your code will work properly. Another is
that you might have to adjust your code to get it working.
I must say though that many of the coding adjustments that
I suggest are actually good (and normal) coding
practices.</p>

<p> The good thing is that I can tell you where you have to adjust your
code.</p>

<p> In my case I had almost 300 Kb of PHP code before I started designing
POBS. It took me a while to adjust my code to get it working properly after
being processed by POBS. If your program doesn't work properly after been
POBSed, here is some debugging advice.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>After using POBS you might want to check whether your program still works
properly. If it doesn't you need to debug.</p>

<p> In the PHP - includefile named "pobs-ini.inc" you can indicate if you
like POBS to concatenate lines and to remove indents. If you set them to
FALSE you will be able to more easily read the obfuscated code and see where
things have gone wrong.</p>

<p>In order to debug you want to know if the problem lies with the
replacement of variables, functions or constants. Normally, variables give
the most problems since a scripting language like PHP allows you to declare
them very dynamically (think for instance of $$Var or the PHP function <a
href="http://www.php.net/parse_str">parse_str</a>). So you want to continue
more modestly and turn the replacement of variables, constants and functions
on and off. That way it's easier to conclude where your code causes
problems.</p>
