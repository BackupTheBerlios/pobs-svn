    <p>A new version of POBS has been rolled out of the POBS factory. <a

    <p>The following enhancements have been included:</p>
    
    <ul>
    
      <li>dividing obfuscation of PHP and JavaScript scripts</li>
      <li>added variable $LineExclude (into INI file), POBS will not obfuscate any line</li>
      <li>that contain string specified there. Look to ini file for more details</li>
      <li>improved concatenation of lines</li>
      <li>added possibility to insert copyright message (or any text) on the top of
          processed scripts</li>

        <ul>
  	<li>&lt;? // something(); ?&gt;</li>

    <p><img class="news" src="img/news.gif" alt="News!"/>
    We are glad to bring you version 0.97 of POBS. Again, Mark from Slovakia

    files without file-extension can be processed. <a
    href="download.html">Download it here!</a></p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  
  <p>The documentation is in the form of this website. It's a bit outdated but
  I hope to offer a updated version soon. You can download it here. <a
  href="myfiles/pobsdoc-nov8-2001.zip">pobsdoc-nov8-2001.zip</a></p>
    
  
  <h2>Hand over the code and still sleep well</h2>
  
  <p>POBS stands for PHP Obfuscater. It is a free and open PHP program
  that makes PHP sourcecode almost impossible to read and edit for normal
  humans. It is a simple way to protect your PHP sourcecode from people who
  would like to adjust it or who would like to know its workings. Now you can
  deploy your application and feel pretty safe about it.</p>
  
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  
  <p>POBS works by replacing User-defined function names, variables and
  constants with a MD5 key of 8 characters. POBS writes new "encrypted"
  source code files and doesn't need a describer. It really removes information
  that humans would like to have but computers don't care about. It's not ideal
  but quite a good option in my idea.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Advantages</h2>
  
    <ul>
  
      <li>No libraries or decoders needed for deployment</li>
      <li>Irreversible encoding</li>
      <li>Hard to reverse-engineer (for humans and/or machines)</li>
      <li>Cross-platform, cross PHP version</li>
      <li>Open Source, so it can be adjusted to your own needs</li>
      <li>Works seamlessly with PHP cachers like APC and ZEND Cache</li>
      <li>Works with Zend Encoder (although you probably don't need it anymore)</li>
  
    </ul>
  
  
  <h2>Share your experiences and thoughts</h2>
  
  <p>In order to make POBS more user-friendly, secure and feature-rich, you are
  invited to share your experiences with us. You can use the guestbook or
  email.</p>
