<a name="par160" id="par160"></a><h3>Do you use POBS yourself?</h3>

<p>Yes I do. I have about 300 Kb of PHP code. After adjusting the software for
POBS, I now know what POBS likes and doesn't like and every update of the
software can be POBSed without a hitch.</p>

<a name="par74" id="par74"></a><h3>Why wouldn't I use Zend Encoder instead?</h3>

<p><em>Price</em><br /> I can tell you about my own considerations. I
seriously considered Zend Encoder and downloaded it together with the manuals
since I thought they where the only option for deploying your application
safely. I found the price quite high but that alone it didn't deter me.
Also, installation didn't seem easy to me.</p>

<p><em>Works with other programs</em><br /> On top of that I already used APC
as a cacher. And as far as I know APC and Zend Encoder don't operate in
concert. So I would have to install Zend Cache too.  (And Zend
Optimizer). Obviously, if you already use APC, Zend Encoder or Zend Cache,
you can continue doing so with POBS.</p>

<p><em>Can not be reverse-engineered by a computer</em><br /> Another
consideration is that Zend Encoder doesn't remove information. As far as I
understand (correct me if I'm wrong) you can adjust the PHP Engine (not for
the everyday coder maybe) and restore the complete sourcecode even if you use
an Encoder and/or a Cacher.  The kind of encoding Zend Encoder does is
reversible.  The encoding POBS does is not reversible since the meaning is
thrown away. The meaning of the code is only know after spending a lot of
time studying it. One would have to give every variable, constant and
function a meaningful name which can only be done after finding out the
working of every function.</p>

<p><em>Deployment at ISP without trouble</em><br /> If you want to deploy a
PHP application at an ISP and you want to protect your sourcecode for
whatever reason , normally you can't ask them to install something like Zend
Encoder for you. In that case, POBS can do the job and you can sleep
tight.</p>

<a name="par122" id="par122"></a><h3>Why would I favor Zend Encoder over POBS?</h3>

<p>Since I try to be objective and do not claim that POBS is the greatest
invention since sliced bread, I guess there certainly are advantages to an
encoder like Zend Encoder or Microcode (see the </a> <a href=
"links.html">Links</a> page).</p>

<p>If the machine, and not just a directory, that runs your program is
controlled by you, you can install an encoder. The advantage of an encoder is
that it obfuscates everything. It may be compared to zipping your PHP files
with a password on top of it.</p>

<p>POBS obfuscates user-defined variables, functions and constants. Not
standard PHP functions, variables or constants. Also, POBS does not obfuscate
database passwords or encryption methods that are used inside your PHP
program. And it doesn't obfuscate standard text.</p>

<p>Also, Zend or Microcode do not require your code to be adjusted. And you
know it will work as intended.</p>

<a name="par163" id="par163"></a><h3>How much work would it be to adjust my code?</h3>

<p>Difficult question. The last thing I want is to disappoint you and have
you put a lot of work in it without proper results. It all depends on:</p>

<p><em>The size of your application</em><br /> Obviously, the larger your
application, the more work you have to put in it.</p>

<p><em>The way you program</em><br /> I myself made the mistake of naming
constants after HTML tags. Also, I didn't start them with a lowercase "c" or
something to set them apart from tags or other stuff. Replacement was
relatively easy since you can easily scan your code for "define".</p>

<p>Another thing is that you might declare a lot of variable variables in
your code with "parse_str" or $$Var. These give POBS troubles and you have to
put in more work if you use a lot of it.</p>

<p><em>The level of security you want</em><br /> With a scripting language
like PHP, variables pose the greatest threat. Variables can be declared on
runtime so you never know which ones will be there.  If you only replace
functionnames and constantnames you have a lower level of obfuscation but you
need to make far fewer adjustments. Anyway, I would advise anyone to start
off and replace only functionnames and constants and see if you code
works. If it does, proceed and replace variablenames also.</p>

<a name="par55" id="par55"></a><h3>What does obfuscate mean?</h3>

<p>Good question. I had never heard of it before talking to people about my
program to obscure PHP code. I always talked of obscuring and couldn't find
similar programs (which do not exist anyway) until someone told me it goes
under the name of "obfuscater".</p>

<p>This is what Merriam Webster dictionary has to
say about it:</p>

<p>
Main Entry: ob&#183;fus&#183;cate<br />
Pronunciation: '&#228;b-f&amp;-"skAt;
&#228;b-'f&amp;s-"kAt, &amp;b-<br />
Function: transitive verb<br />
Inflected Form(s): -cat&#183;ed;
-cat&#183;ing<br />
Etymology: Late Latin obfuscatus, past participle
of obfuscare, from<br />
Latin ob- in the way + fuscus dark brown -- more
at OB-, DUSK<br />
Date: 1577<br />
1 a : DARKEN b : to make obscure<br />
2 : CONFUSE<br />
</p>

<a name="par64" id="par64"></a><h3>With what has POBS been tested?</h3>

<p>POBS has only been tested with PHP 4.0.4 on Linux and Win32. It will
probably work on other PHP versions as well since I can't imagine why it
wouldn't work. But this is certainly not a guarantee.</p>

<a name="par65" id="par65"></a><p>What about $$Var?</h3>

<p>Variable variables pose a problem for POBS.  But they can easily be
overcome.</p>

<p>Consider the following code snippet:</p>

<code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /><br />$Var1</span><span
style="color: #007700"> = </span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"Var2"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />$</span><span
style="color: #0000BB">$Var1</span><span style="color: #007700"> = </span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Amsterdam"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br
/>echo </span><span style="color: #0000BB">$Var2</span><span style="color:
#007700">; </span><span style="color: #FF8000">// "Amsterdam"<br /><br
/></span><span style="color: #0000BB">?&gt;<br /></span>
</span>
</code

<p>$Var2 will have the value "Amsterdam"</p>

<p>POBS makes the following code of it:<br /><br />

<code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /><br />$V31bff649</span><span
style="color: #007700"> = </span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"Var2"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />$$</span><span
style="color: #0000BB">31bff649</span><span style="color:
#007700"> = </span><span style="color: #DD0000">"Amsterdam"</span><span
style="color: #007700">;<br />echo </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">$V8c4e34d5</span><span style="color: #007700">; </span><span
style="color: #FF8000">// empty<br /><br /></span><span style="color:
#0000BB">?&gt;<br /></span>
</span>
</code

<p>As you see POBS has replaced all occurences of $Var2 but not
Var2. Therefore this little program will not work as intended. To get it
working you need to add Var2 to the $UdExcVarArray in pobs-ini.inc.</p>


<a name="par72" id="par72"></a><h3>Will execution of the scripts be slower?</h3>

<p>Probably not. I haven't noticed nor measured. According to one user
execution time was 9% faster after obfuscating. Also, the sourcefiles were
about 10% smaller in size.</p>


<a name="par73" id="par73"></a><h3>Will it increase the size of the PHP
script files?</h3>

<p>That depends. But generally not. (Au contraire). If you remove comments
and indents and have the lines concatenated your files will, on average lose
about 10% of their size. If you only have the variables, constants and
functions replaced it will probably result in a slight increase in filesize
since the average length of variables and functionames is slightly smaller
than 9 (First letter + MD5 of 8 characters).</p>


<a name="par78" id="par78"></a><h3>Can I process selected files of my application?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can! From version 0.91 on, POBS automatically checks if the sourcefile is newer than the
targetfilet. It then only rewrites the new ones.</p>

<p>But remember, although POBS can replace selectively, POBS <em>needs to
scan all the files of your application</em> . It must, to be sure it knows all the
userdefined functions, variables and constants in your application.</p>


<a name="par87" id="par87"></a><h3>How long does it all take?</h3>

<p>Depending on the total size of your sourcefiles and the number of
functions, constants and variables used it might take POBS quite a long time
to process them. This has also to do with the incomplete functions that PHP
offers and is a major disadvantage to PHP in my opinion. In my case,
processing 250 Kb of source in about 40 files takes about 600 seconds on a
300 Mhz machine. If you have suggestions as to how it can be made speedier
please let me know.</p>

<p>If you made adjustments to the code in certain files, you can instruct
POBS to just replace those files to speed up processing.</p>

<p>Standard timeout for PHP is 30 seconds or something. This is probably not
enough. In the pobs-ini.inc file you can adjust the timeout. POBS will set it
when it is started up. It is necessary though that PHP does not run in "Safe
mode".  In php.ini you can set "Safe mode" off.</p>


<a name="par92" id="par92"></a><h3>Doesn't APC provide enough security?</h3>

<p>Depending on the security you need, it very well might do so. APC provides
a mode (mmap) in which only "compiled" PHP files are stored on the
server. These are pretty hard to read and might discourage many hackers from
trying to decode them. But it's quite possible to reverse the compiling
process by way of another program (that you need to write yourself
probably). So, if you need to deploy an application and want to feel really
safe and secure, I don't think a cacher like APC is the way to go. But of
course, APC was never intended for such purposes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>APC does not encrypt or throw away information. Machine reversible.</li>
  <li>Zend Encoder does encrypt but doesn't throw away information. Machine reversible.</li>
  <li>POBS encrypts by way of throwing away information. Never completely
  reversible. Only partly reversible by intensely studying the code.</li>
</ul>


<a name="par97" id="par97"></a><h3>Shouldn't all software be free and open?</h3>

<p>For me that's like saying: "Shouldn't everyone on earth be peaceful,
loving and working together". I rather work with reality than project my
ideals on it.</p>

<p>If everyone works for free I will do likewise. But that isn't the case
yet. Contrary to Richard Stallman I don't think all software should be free
and open.  Open and closed software both have their advantages and
disadvantages. The one who writes software (or the owner) should decide what
he wants to share. In my opinion the same goes for money and property, which
is called Capitalism or libertarianism.</p>



<a name="par104" id="par104"></a><h3>Can I obfuscatepart of my PHP application?</h3>

<p>No. For obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Many PHP applications consist of many separate files that can be included
at will. If you replace a functionname in file A you have to replace all
occurences of that function in every other PHP program.</p>

<p><em>But</em>, POBS allows you to select the files you want to obfuscate to
make processing faster. If you POBSed everything already but made adjustments
to just a few files you can instruct POBS to replace just these.</p>


<a name="par108" id="par108"></a><h3>Are there any other PHP Obfuscators?</h3>

<p>I would wish there were many, so I wouldn't have to write my own. But
there's only one at <a href= "http://www.hotscripts.com/Detailed/10841.html"
target="_new">http://www.hotscripts.com/Detailed/10841.html</a> which is
rather limited and not very secure. It deals with variables only. I
downloaded the source and concluded it didn't suit my needs. Too bad.</p>


<a name="par133" id="par133"></a><h3>Do I need a decoder?</h3>

<p>No, luckily it doesn't.  POBS doesn't work that way.  What it does is
irreversible.</p>


<a name="par149" id="par149"></a><h3>Do you offer a money-back guarantee?</h3>

<p>Of course! If, for any reason, POBS does not live up to your expectations,
you can send it back and receive every penny you paid for it.</p>


<a name="par162" id="par162"></a><h3>Can I exclude too many variables,
functions or constants?</h3>

<p>No, not really. Only too few. But, of course, the more you exclude the
less obfuscated it becomes.</p>


<a name="par178" id="par178"></a><h3>But why obfuscate, since PHP code is
never seen by the person at the end of the browser?</h3>

<p>Hard to understand why people don't understand the uses of something like
POBS. POBS can be specifically helpful when you need to deploy your
application at an ISP or customer. Also, even if an hacker breaks in to your
own machine he couldn't do much with your code.</p>
