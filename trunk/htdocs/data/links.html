        <a name="par83" id="par83"></a> POBS is not proclaimed to be an ideal solution for
        securing your intellectual property. Below are some links to other options.<br />
        <br />
        <b>CodeLock</b><br />
        <a href="http://www.codelock.co.nz/" target="_blank">CodeLock</a> is a product from
        New Zealand with which you can affordably encrypt your PHP scripts or code before
        distribution.<br />
        <br />
        <b>SourceGuardian</b><br />
        <a href="http://www.phpguardian.com/" target="_blank">SourceGuardian</a> is a
        commercial product which sells for around 200 US dollars depending on the version.
        The normal version is for obfuscating only and the Pro version for encrypting as
        well.<br />

          <a name="par225" id="par225"></a> <b>PHPCrypter</b><br />
          It seems POBS has been cloned already by someone from Bulgaria. The nicest form of
          flattery is imitation they say. PHPCrypter is "Small and smart". That applies to
          POBS too then ;-)<br />
          It seems like a GPL violation. Visit the site at <a href=
          "http://phpcrypter.hit.bg/" target="_blank">http://phpcrypter.hit.bg/</a> . He asks
          100 Euro for it but offers documentation and three months email support. Good luck
          to you.<br />

            <a name="par96" id="par96"></a> <b>Zend</b><br />
            <a href='http://www.zend.com' target="STD4">Zend</a> provides many tools for PHP
            programmers. It also maintains the PHP sourcecode. It's tools are closed-source
            and have a pricetag. Most of them, that is.<br />

              German company has released a <b>free and open</b> competitor to Zend Encoder
              in august 2001. Check it out. I wonder whether is works together with APC.
              Maybe they can team up.<br />

                    Unix-like operating system which is free software: the GNU system. (GNU
                    is a recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''; it is pronounced
                    "guh-NEW".) Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel
                    Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as
                    ``Linux'', they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.<br />
