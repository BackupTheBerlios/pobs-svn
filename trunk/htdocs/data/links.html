<h2>CodeLock</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.codelock.co.nz/" target="_blank">CodeLock</a> is a
product from New Zealand with which you can affordably encrypt your PHP
scripts or code before distribution.</p>


<h2>SourceGuardian</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.phpguardian.com/" target="_blank">SourceGuardian</a>
is a commercial product which sells for around 200 US dollars depending on
the version.  The normal version is for obfuscating only and the Pro version
for encrypting as well.</p>


<h2>PHPCrypter</h2>

<p>It seems POBS has been cloned already by someone from Bulgaria. The nicest
form of flattery is imitation they say. PHPCrypter is "Small and smart". That
applies to POBS too then ;-)</p>

<p>It seems like a GPL violation. Visit the site at <a href=
"http://phpcrypter.hit.bg/" target="_blank">http://phpcrypter.hit.bg/</a>. He
asks 100 Euro for it but offers documentation and three months email
support. Good luck to you.</p>


<h2>Zend Encoder</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.zend.com' target="_blank">Zend</a> provides many tools
for PHP programmers. It also maintains the PHP source-code. Its tools are
closed-source and have a pricetag. Most of them, that is.</p>


<h2>Microcode</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.microcode.de" target="_blank">Microcode PHP
encoder</a> This German company has released a <strong>free and open</strong>
competitor to Zend Encoder in august 2001. Check it out. I wonder whether is
works together with APC.  Maybe they can team up.</p>


<h2>APC</h2>

<p><a href="http://apc.communityconnect.com/index.html"
target="_blank">APC</a> Alternative PHP Cache. Useful stuff to speed up
(large) PHP applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_blank">GNU - Free Software
Foundation</a> The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete
Unix-like operating system which is free software: the GNU system. (GNU is a
recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".)
Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now
widely used; though these systems are often referred to as "Linux", they
are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.</p>
