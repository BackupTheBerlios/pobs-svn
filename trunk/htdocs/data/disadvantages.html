<h1>Disadvantages</h1>

<p>POBS is not for people who want a quick fix. I you seriously want to
obfuscate your code and are prepared to a few hours work in it, POBS is a
serious option. I don't want to scare you off, but don't want to promise you
a rosegarden either.</p>

<h2>Your probably have to adjust some codelines to get it working</h2>

<p>The downside of POBS is that it won't guarantee that your code will work
properly without adjustments. This has to do with the way scripting languages
like PHP deal with variables. As you probably know you can dynamically define
(maybe "use" is a better word) variables in PHP.  This poses a problem for
POBS or any other Obfuscator.  But you can deal with it by scanning your code
for things like $$VarName and parse_str and edit your code or add variables
to the array of excluded variables ($UdExcVarArray).</p>

<p>I must say though that many of the coding adjustments that I suggest are
actually good (and normal) coding practices. Like starting every constant
with a lower "c" and putting the rest in uppercase. Or naming all variables
of a certain kind according to a naming convention.</p>

<p>Since I don't make any money out of POBS (I only improve it for you guys,
which makes me feel like the son of Mother Theresa) I hate to see
disappointed faces. So don't think you don't have to put effort in getting
your code to work. If you want POBS to replace the variables (besides
functions and constants) in your application, you might need to spend a few
hours adjusting your code.  Replacing functionnames and constants probably
won't give you any trouble (providing you don't define constants like "HREF",
"ALIGN" and "SRC").</p>

<p>See</a> <a href="codingtips.html">Codingtips</a> and <a
href="tips.html">Debugtips</a> on how to prevent problems and get your code
working (I got my 300 Kb code working without my own advice so there is no
need to get discouraged).</p>

<h2>No password protection</h2>

<p>POBS will not protect against the proliferation of passwords used in your
sourcecode. I.e. if your PHP program connects to a MySQL database you
probably use the PHP function "mysql_connect". One of the parameters is a
password. POBS doesn't obfuscate the function (since it is not user -defined)
nor the password. You might make a deliberate complex function that generates
a password but a hacker could just call that function and see what it
returns.</p>

<p>For me, protecting against database passwords or stuff is not really
important because POBS is essentially targeted at applications that need to
be deployed. I.e.  on a customers computer. In that situation a customer
might have full access to the computer and deals with his own data in the
database anyway.</p>

<p>Zend Encoder and Microcode Encoder do protect passwords since they encrypt
those too (they probably encrypt the whole PHP file like "WinZip + password"
would do).</p>
