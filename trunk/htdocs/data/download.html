<p><strong>Warning</strong></p>

<p>POBS is not for people who want a quick fix. If you seriously want to
obfuscate your code and are prepared to a few hours work in it, POBS is a
serious option. I don't want to scare you off, but don't want to promise you
a rosegarden either.</p>

<p>The files are a mere 25Kb in size. If you would ask MicroSoft, this
requires distribution via CD Rom. And an install-program of course. Luckily,
POBS requires neither one of them.</p>

<h2>Version 0.99 - August 10th 2003</h2>

<p><a href="files/downloads/pobs099.zip">pobs099.zip</a></p>

<p>Some features in this release:</p>

<ul>

  <li>dividing obfuscation of PHP and JavaScript scripts</li>
  <li>added variable $LineExclude (into INI file), POBS will not obfuscate
  any line that contain string specified there. Look to ini file for more description</li>
  <li>improved concatenation of lines</li>
  <li>added possibility to insert copyright message (or any text) on the
  top of processed scripts</li>
  <li>some bugs fixed:

    <ul>
      <li>&lt;?php // something(); ?&gt;</li>
      <li>problem with obfuscating of class name from anze@volja.net</li>
      <li>some other small bugs</li>
    </ul>
  
  </li>

</ul>
    
<h2>Version 0.981 - May 12th 2003</h2>
    
<a href="myfiles/downloads/pobs0981.zip">pobs0981.zip</a> &mdash; Better Javascript handling and some bugfixes.</p>
    
<h2>Version 0.97 - December 26th 2002</h2>

<p><a href="myfiles/downloads/pobs097.zip">pobs097.zip</a></p>

<ul>

  <li>corrected javascript replacements if the tage is different from simple &lt;script&gt; (for example  &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;)</li>
  <li>added possibility to process also files without extension - such files will be specified by dot (".") in $FileExtArray variable</li>
  <li>corrected problem with removing newlines and //, or # comments - the
  side effect is also that the specification of number of preserved comments
  now applies also to // and # comments, not only to /**/ comments</li>

</ul>
      
<h2>Version 0.96 - August 27th 2002</h2>

<ul>
  
  <li>added $UdExcFileArray and $UdExcDirArray to allow specification of
  files and directories that will be excluded from obfuscation. There is a
  difference in behaviour between those two arrays.  Any file name that will
  match entry in $UdExcFileARray will be not scanned and obfuscated, but will
  be copied to the target directory. Any directory that will match entry in
  $UdExcDirArray will be passed without obfuscation and WILL BE NOT copied into
  target directory</li>
          
  <li>improved comments removal handling. It is possible to specify how many
  first comments will be not removed (idea is to preserve copyright
  comments). This applies only to /* ... */ comments, other comments are always
  removed, because they cause problems where returns removal is enabled.</li>

  <li>corrected bug that caused 'Empty delimiter' warning</li>

  <li>not showing that creation of directory failed if directory already
  exists</li>

  <li>corrected bugs on functions and variables replacement, when pobs
  replaced only part of the variable/function</li>

  <li> added swith for replacing classes</li>

</ul>

  variables (unselecting had no effect before)</li>

</ul>
