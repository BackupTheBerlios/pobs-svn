<h1>How it works</h1>

<h2>Replace names</h2>

<p>POBS replaces user-defined (NOT predefined) functions, constants and
variables with a MD5 key of 8 characters. (It doesn't use MD5 keys of 32
bytes, which is standard, since that would increase the size of your
sourcecode). 8 bytes seems enough to give each functions or variable its
unique name. MD5 is not reversible.</p>

<p> The first letter of the new functionname is a "F", of a variable a "V"
and of a constant a "C"</p>

<p>
  The function with name MakeImageHtml is replaced by Fee2c1bdc<br />
  The variable $ImgText is replaced by $V1d9d94a6<br />
  The constant USERDIR is replaced by C389a367e<br />
</p>

<h2>Futher obscuring</h2>

<p> In addition, POBS can be instructed to concatenate lines and remove
comments and indents. These are not irreversible since a person can write a
program to add indents and returns. But it really makes a mess of your code
and therefore furtherly discourages many wouldbe hackers from trying to
reverse-engineer your code.</p>

<h2>Exclude stuff</h2>

<p>POBS allows you to indicate which user-defined variables, constants and
functions need to be excluded from replacing. In the settings file
"pobs-ini.inc" you can add these names to the arrays $UdExVarArray,
$UdExcConstArray and $UdExcFuncArray. Do NOT use dollarsigns here.</p>

<p>In $UdExVarArray you are allowed to use <strong>wildcards</strong> in the
form of an asterix (*) at the end of each variablename. I.e. params_* will
exclude params_type, params_address and params_name. So if you name your
variables to a certain convention you can easily and securely exclude them by
group. This way you don't have to be afraid you forgot to add it to the array
in case you added a new variable to your code.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>POBS consists of 2 major processes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>POBS first scans all the files with the file-extensions allowed in the
      sourcedirectory. While scanning, it makes a list of userdefined
      variables, functions and constants it has located in your sourcecode.
  </li>
  <li>POBS now knows which ones it should replace and starts writing new
      files in the target directory.
  </li>
</ol>
