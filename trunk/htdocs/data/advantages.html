<h1>Advantages</h1>

<h2>In General</h2>

<p>Encoders like Zend Encoder and Microcode and cachers like APC have the
advantage of making it more difficult for others to use your code and get
away with your intellectual property. Another objective is to prevent others
from peeking into your code and find security holes.</p>

<p>POBS has the same objectives but establishes it by other means. It's not
an ideal solution but it has the following advantages and disadvantages over
other methods.</p>

<h2>No need for libraries or decoders</h2>

<p>POBS works without external libraries, modules or decoders. That makes
POBS ideal for deploying your application at an ISP or customer. Especially
with ISPs it's difficult to persuade them to install the decoder you need
(I.e.  Zend Encoder). With POBS you can deploy with peace of mind.</p>

<h2>Hard to reverse-engineer</h2>

<p>POBS removes information from your sourcecode. In a way this is safer than
using <a href= "http://www.zend.com" target="_new">Zend Encoder</a> or <a
href="http://www.microcode.de" target= "_new">MicroCode</a> since they can be
reverse-engineered by adjusting the PHP engine. Not with POBS. With POBS you
can almost eagerly hand over the sourcecode to a third party without losing
sleep. Zend Encoder and Microcode can not guarantee the safety of your
sourcecode (POBS is not guaranteed either but I hope you understand the
difference).</p>

<h2>Cross-platform, cross PHP version</h2>

<p>Since PHP Obfuscator is written in PHP 4.x and PHP is cross-platform, PHP
Obfuscator is cross-platform too. What is more, you can Obfuscate your
sourcecode on a Win32 machine and run it without any modification on a Linux
machine.</p>

<h2>Compatible with other tools</h2>

<p>The good thing about PHP Obfuscator is that it doesn't prevent you from
using APC Cache or ZEND Cacher in addition. If you really want things secure
you might add Zend Encoder.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>PHP Obfuscator is Open Source GPL style. Since you might want to use PHP
Obfuscator to protect your sourcecode you have knowledge of PHP and can
adjust PHP Obfuscator to your own liking.  Of course, you are encouraged to
share your enhancements with the rest of the world.</p>
