<h1>Codingtips</h1>

<p>Before being POBSed, you probably need to adjust your sourcecode here and
there.  Especially in case you have chosen to also replace variables. In a
scripting language like PHP, variables may create most of the problems. Below
are some problems and solutions.</p>

<h2>Don't name constants after HTML tags</h2>

<p>POBS finds it hard to really find the constantnames.  Contrary to
variables, constants in PHP do not start with a indicator like a dollar-sign
($). If you have defined constants with names like "HTML" or "HEAD", POBS
will replace both these constants and these HTML tags with a new name,
thinking they are constants. In order to avoid this, simply start every (or
at least every dubious constantname) with a "c". I personally find it good
practise to use uppercase for each constantname except for the first
letter. So something like cUSERNAME and cHEAD. This will generally prevent
problems.</p>

<p>

<h2>Check for parse_str</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.php.net/parse_str">parse_str</a> is useful PHP
function which scans a string (i.e. a query_string) and generates variables.
So a string with "Var1=3&amp;Var2=X&amp;Var3=123" processed by parse_str
would result in the declaration of 3 variables and the according values would
be assigned to them.</p>

<p> This is particularly useful when passing many parameters to a certain
function.</p>

<code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /><br /></span><span style="color:
#007700">function </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">ProcessStuff</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span
style="color: #0000BB">$ParamsStr</span><span style="color: #007700">) {<br
/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color:
#0000BB">parse_str</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span
style="color: #0000BB">$ParamsStr</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br
/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If (</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$Var1
</span><span style="color: #007700">== </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">4</span><span style="color: #007700">) echo </span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Yes"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If (</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$Var2
</span><span style="color: #007700">== </span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"X"</span><span style="color: #007700">) </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">DoThis</span><span style="color: #007700">() ;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If (</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$Var3
</span><span style="color: #007700">== </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">999</span><span style="color: #007700">) echo </span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Very much"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br
/><br />}<br /><br /></span><span style="color:
#0000BB">ProcessStuff</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Var1=3&amp;Var2=Y&amp;Var3=456"</span><span
style="color: #007700">);<br /><br /></span><span style="color:
#0000BB">?&gt;<br /></span>
</span>
</code

<p> The example above would go wrong if been processed by POBS. POBS deals
with the problems posed by functions like parse_str. POBS not only replaces
$Var1 with a new name but also all occurences of &amp;Var1. In the example
above, Var2 and Var3 would do fine but Var1 would go wrong. POBS will replace
$Var1 but will not replace Var1 in the parameterstring since it is not
preceded by an ampersand (&amp;). To avoid this problem simply add a
preceding ampersand to the first variable in the parameter string.</p>

<p><code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php
ProcessStuff</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"Var1=3&amp;Var2=Y&amp;Var3=456"</span><span style="color:
#007700">); </span><span style="color: #0000BB">?&gt;</span> </span>
</code>is wrong.<br />

<code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php
ProcessStuff</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"<strong>&amp;</strong>Var1=3&amp;Var2=Y&amp;Var3=456"</span><span
style="color: #007700">); </span><span style="color: #0000BB">?&gt;</span>
</span> </code>is right.</p>

<p>

<h2>Dealing with set_error_handler("&lt;functionname&gt;");</h2>

<p>If you use the function set_error_handler("myErrorHandler") "myErrorHandler"
is the name of a function. POBS will replace the functionname everywhere
except when used as a parameter for another function. So you will have a
problem. To avoid it, add the appropriate functioname (i.e. "myErrorHandler"
) to the $UdExcFuncArray in the pobs-ini.inc.php file.</p>

<p>This problem will be dealt with in future versions of POBS.</p>

<h2>Double slashes and comments removal</h2>

<p>Removing comments from your source code obviously helps in preventing
others using it. You can optionally instruct POBS to remove comments. This
should only be done after everything else is obfuscated and your POBSed
program works.</p>

<p>In order for POBS to find comments it searches for double slashes in your
code <strong>preceded by a space or tab character</strong> (like " //"). It
does not (yet?) check whether these slashes are somewhere in between quotes
(in case they would <strong>not</strong> be comments). This could give you a
problem in case you have something like:</p>

<p><code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color:
#0000BB">header</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Location: http://pobs.mywalhalla.net"</span><span
style="color: #007700">); </span></span> </code> in your code.</p>

<p>But since the double slashes are not preceded by a tab or space here, POBS
will not consider //pobs.mywalhalla.net a comment.</p>

<h2>Dealing with variable variables ($$Var1)</h2>

<p>Consider the following code snippet:</p>

<code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color:
#0000BB">$Var1&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">= </span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Var2"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br
/>$</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$Var1 </span><span style="color:
#007700">= </span><span style="color: #DD0000">"Amsterdam"</span><span
style="color: #007700">;<br />echo </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">$Var2</span><span style="color: #007700">; </span><span
style="color: #FF8000">// "Amsterdam"<br /></span></span></code>

<p><span style="color: #0000BB">$Var2</span> will have the value
"Amsterdam"</p>

<p>POBS makes the following code of it:</p>

<code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color: #0000BB">$V31bff649
</span><span style="color: #007700">= </span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"Var2"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />$$</span><span
style="color: #0000BB">31bff649 </span><span style="color: #007700">=
</span><span style="color: #DD0000">"Amsterdam"</span><span style="color:
#007700">;<br />echo </span><span style="color:
#0000BB">$V8c4e34d5</span><span style="color: #007700">; </span><span
style="color: #FF8000">// empty<br /></span></span> </code>

<p>As you see POBS has replaced all occurences of $Var2 but not
Var2. Therefore this little program will not work as intended. To get it
working you need to add Var2 to the $UdExcVarArray in pobs-ini.inc.</p>

<h2>Dealing with $GLOBALS and $HTTP_POST_VARS</h2>

<p>$GLOBALS is a predefined array in which all the global variables are
present. In many programs variables are added to this array.</p>

<p> POBS replaces both $Var as $GLOBALS["var"] or $GLOBALS[var] occurences in
your code so this will generally not cause problems. But you might have a
strange unusual situation with i.e. $GLOBALS[strtolower($VarX)] where POBS
will not work properly. You would have to add $VarX to the exclude
user-defined variables array in pobs-ini.inc.</p>

<p> From version 0.92 POBS <strong><em>does</em></strong> also deal with
$HTTP_POST_VARS, $HTTP_GET_VARS and $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS.</p>

<h2>Forms and fields</h2>

<p>If a user submits a form that is given to a PHP script, PHP automatically
creates variables with names corresponding with the names of the input fields
of the form.</p>

<p>POBS deals with this by also replacing every field in every form</p>

<p>So, consider the following HTML code:</p>

<code>
&lt;form method="post" action="do-it.php"&gt;<br />
&lt;input type="text" name="address"&gt;<br />
&lt;form&gt;
</code>

<p>The PHP script do-it.php has references to $address. POBS will replace
it. And POBS also replaces NAME=address with that same value.</p>

<p>A problem arises when a program outputs forms automatically. POBS can no
longer find code like :</p>

<code>echo '&lt;input type="text" name="address"&gt;';</code>

<p>but will instead find something like:</p>

<code>echo '&lt;input type="text" name=' . CreateFieldName("address") . '&gt;';</code>

<br/>or<br />

<code>echo CreateFieldName("address", cTEXT);</code>

<p> and will not replace the fieldnames.</p>

<p> The remedy would be (that's what I did) to let all created fieldnames by
CreateFieldName() start with the same letters. Something like "field_". This
would result in something like "field_address" and "field_phone" etc).You
would than just have to add the entry "field_*" (don't forget the wildcard!)
to the <code style="color: #0000BB">$UdExcVarArray</code> in pobs-ini.inc and
the problems are over.</p>

<h2>Inline HTML and &lt;pre&gt;</h2>

<p>Programmers can use inline HTML in their PHP files. When POBS is
instructed to concatenate codelines it normally is not a problem and doesn't
compromise the HTML since carriage returns are not presented by return
characters in HTML but by &lt;br&gt;. But, when &lt;pre&gt; is used before a
piece of HTML code the browser interprets each return character as a
&lt;br&gt;. Another problem with inline HTML is laid out in the paragraph
below.</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt;<br /> This text will be displayed exactly as is seen here.<br
/> Every return in this text is interpreted as a carriage return by your
browser.<br /> &lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>And this is what POBS can make of it:<br />
&lt;pre&gt;<br />
This text will be displayed exactly as is seen here.Every return in this text
is interpreted as a carriage return by your browser.<br />
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<h2>Javascript functions</h2>

<p>Formerly I stated that when you were using inline Javascript you need to
make adjustments. I was wrong. The only possible problem with inline
Javascript I know of, is that you can't let POBS <em>concatenate lines if you
haven't ended each Javascript codeline with a semicolon ";"</em> . I guess
this doesn't need extra explanation.</p>

<p>POBS does not (and can not easily) discriminate between JavaScript
functions and PHP functions. It you declared a Javascript function named "X",
POBS will replace this Javascript function and all references to it.  <em>As
far as I know this will not create problems</em> so there is no need to
worry.</p>

<p>If you don't want your Javascript functions to be replaced, i.e. in case
you want to debug it more easily, you can add them to $UdExcFuncArray in
pobs-ini.inc or you can replace the inline Javascript with Javascript echoed
by PHP. An example is shown below:</p>

<code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color: #0000BB"></span><span
style="color: #007700">echo </span><span style="color: #DD0000">"function
JsCheckField() {"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />echo </span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"&lt;Javascript code lines&gt;;"</span><span
style="color: #007700">;<br />echo </span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"}"</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br /></span></span> </code

<p>This way POBS doesn' t consider "JsCheckField()" to be a function that
needs replacement.</p>

<h2>Extracting associative arrays</h2>

<p>If you create an associative array and then extract() it, the extracted
variables don't have encoded names.  Here's an example.</p>

<p>
Given an array such as:<br />
$Va43fae1e=array('abpath'=&gt;$Ve3f46e6e,
'unabpath'=&gt;$V01031f9e);</p>

<p>This won't work:<br />
extract($Va43fae1e);<br />
because elsewhere you no longer have $abpath and $unabpath as variable names
(they'd be obfuscated).</p>

<p>To deal with the problem you must add "abpath" and "unabpath" to
$UdExcVarArray.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>From version 0.93 on POBS deals properly with cookies and users can
discard the cookie helptext presented here.</p>

<p>Cookies might cause problems since they are used in a normal fashion but
defined and set in an unusual way.</p>

<code><span style="color: #000000"> <span style="color: #0000BB">setcookie
</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color:
#DD0000">"TestCookie"</span><span style="color: #007700">, </span><span
style="color: #DD0000">"Test Value"</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br
/>echo </span><span style="color: #0000BB">$TestCookie</span><span
style="color: #007700">;<br /></span></span> </code>

<p>After POBS has done it's work the cookie "TestCookie" will still have be
set but displaying the contents of the cookie will result in an empty
string.</p>

<p>In the future POBS might just deal properly with this problem by also
replacing setcookie("CookieName", "CookieValue") with setcookie("Veda45e23",
"CookieValue"). But now it doesn't and here is what I suggest you to do.</p>

<p>Exclude all cookievariables by adding them to $UdExcVarArray in
pobs-ini.inc. This is easiest done (and most secure) if you name every cookie
according to a naming convention. Personally I start all cookienames with
"whc_" so that I only have to add "whc_*" to the array. It's also good coding
if you ask me. Scan your sourcefiles for the PHP function "setcookie" and
give the first parameter a new name.</p>
